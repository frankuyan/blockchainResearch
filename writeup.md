## Write up for the challenge [Crypto] [OSINT] [Blockchain] 


### What are some of the tools required to solve this challenge?

1. stellar_sdk -- Python SDK for Stellar XLM blockchain. Necessary for interacting with the blockchain for this challenge. 
2. stellar-sdk-py -- Another Python SDK for Stellar XLM blockchain. 
3. [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert) - Most comprehensive tool for Stellar XLM blockchain. Does have transaction history, memo information, distributed ledger state and more. The most useful thing would be a graph of the balance of the wallet over time. 
4. [Stellar Blockchain Explorer](https://stellarscan.io/) - This is not very good compared to the Stellar Expert, might be more useful if you want to explore the individual transactions. 
5. Other blockchain osint resources on GitHub
    - [Awesome On-Chain Investigations HandBook](https://github.com/OffcierCia/On-Chain-Investigations-Tools-List)
    - [WEB3, CRIPTOCURRENCIES and NFT resources for OSINT investigations](https://github.com/aaarghhh/awesome_osint_blockchain_analysis)
    - [Blockchain Transactions Investigation Tool](https://github.com/s0md3v/Orbit) - I haven't tested this out personally, but it might be worthwhile in exploring this for larger scale (or high level OSINT blockchain challenges)
 

 ### COMPFEST 16 - Open Wallet [Blockchain] 


### Description 
Oh no, I accidentally pushed my secret key on github while developing an arbitrage bot, Now my money is stolen ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Can you help me identify who stole my money? Here is the file i pushed https://github.com/Firdausfarul/Neptunus/blob/master/interleave_testnet_backend/Arbitrageur_XLM_USDC.py . the flag is in blockchain, in one of the thief account.

The script reveals the private key of the wallet, along with some other transaction functions. 

``` python

        )
            .build()
    )

    stellar_account1.sequence += 1
    Transaction1 = (
        TransactionBuilder(
            source_account=stellar_account1,
            network_passphrase=Network.PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE,
            base_fee=base_fee,

    )


    # Signing+Submitting Transaction1
    Transaction1.sign(acc.secret)
    Transaction2.sign(acc.secret)
    response1 = server.submit_transaction(Transaction2)
    response2 = server.submit_transaction(Transaction1)
    print(response1)
    print(response2)


```



### Write up 



The first step would be to attain the public wallet address from this challenge. This can be attain once you have a private key. 


This is just simply. 

``` python

secret_key='SDW5NLCZJEXYK3RNXVZLAPZDMKQNYRVPKZUOFUYBNH4SYNSCJWECSISD'
acc=Keypair.from_secret(secret_key)
print(acc.public_key)

```


Which prints out the public wallet address `GCVMRAQGQZ5VNX7KUT2O6N2SKQR3ENT2Q2JTRL2YBPSQAPXIRZR2BY23` 

Naturally, once we move over to the Stellar Expert, we can see that the wallet has made a few transactions. As the challenge wanted us to focus on the nefarious outward tranactions, we do notice some that have taken place in the fall of 2021.

From this wallet, we see that the majority of transaction are minute airdrop (less than 0.01 XLM) from exchange wallets. Notably, most of these source addresses have been marked as "Scam" by the Stellar community. This suggests that the owner has pretty bad OPSEC and tend the take the bait from crypto charlatans.
